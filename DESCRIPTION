Description: Adds subtotal rows / sections (a la the SAS "Proc Tabulate" "All" option) to a Group By output by running a series of Group By functions with partial sets of the same variables and combining the results with the original. Can be used to add comprehensive information to a data report or to quickly aggregate Group By outputs used to gain a greater understanding of data.
